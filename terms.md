Distribution of Fitness Effect (DFE)
---

 *Motoo Kimura*: Neutral theory of molecular evolution proposes that most novel mutations will be highly deleterious, 
 with a small fraction being neutral
 
 *Hiroshi Akashi*: Proposed a bimodal model for the DFE, with modes centered around highly deleterious and neutral mutations
  
 Both theories agree that *the vast majority of novel mutations are neutral or deleterious and that advantageous mutations 
 are rare*, which has been supported by experimental results
